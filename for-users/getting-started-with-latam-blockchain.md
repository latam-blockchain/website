# Getting Started with Latam-Blockchain

## 1\) Set your Chain ID and RPC

To get started on Latam-Blockchain, you will need to setup your externally owned address \(wallet address\) to access Latan-Blockchain. **You can use the same address you use on Ethereum**, but the chain id and RPC must point to Latam-Blockchain.  

* You can use [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) to quickly add to MetaMask, or
* See the [MetaMask Setup tutorial](wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md) for example steps and configuration.
* If desired, you can also use a [different RPC endpoint](../for-developers/developer-resources/#json-rpc-endpoints) or even [setup your own node to connect](../for-developers/install-latam-blockchain-client/) with.

**Default chain settings:** Network Name: Latam-Blockchain Tesnet,  New RPC URL: [https://rpc.latam-blockchain.com/](https://rpc.latam-blockchain.com/), Chain ID: 0xAC, Symbol: USD, Block Explorer URL: [https://explorer.latam-blockchain.com](https://explorer.latam-blockchain.com)
{% endhint %}

## 2\) Get a Little USD  

* Use the [Latam-Blockchain Faucet](https://faucet.latam-blockchain.com)
* Convert USDT on Ethereum to USD with the [Latam-Blockchain bridge](bridges/converting-usd-via-bridge/).
* Ask on [Latam-Blockchain Discord](https://discord.gg/TncBuWdY6B)


## 3\) BlockScout is your Home Base

BlockScout block explorer is the Latam-Blockchain gateway for exploring activities on the chain and accessing token and contract information. In the Apps menu you can find links to bridges, transaction monitoring tools, staking and more. You can explore the various bridged tokens, view daily transactions, active accounts and other on-chain happenings.

## 4\) Bridges Connecting Ecosystems

You can move tokens between Latam-Blockchain and Ethereum & Binance Smart Chain with available bridges. See the bridges section for more details on each bridge.  If you move a token to Latam-Blockchain, be sure to add the custom token to your wallet. Clicking the fox icon in BlockScout or the Omnibridge will quickly add the token TODO.
