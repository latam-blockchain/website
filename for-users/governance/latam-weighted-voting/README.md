# LATAM weighted voting with Snapshot

LATAM holders participate in the governance process through an integration with snapshot. Community members can vote on proposals and introduce proposals for voting by other members. Once a proposal passes, Latam-Blockchain team works with validators to support the protocol update. 

Note that proposals are not automatically enacted, and some community proposals may not be accepted depending on the viability of the idea or total LATAM amount/ number of voters participating.

{% hint style="info" %}
Snapshot uses your LATAM balance on Ethereum as well as LATAM locked in EasyStaking for voting weight**.**

## Vote on an existing proposal

1\) Go to the Latam-Blockchain Snapshot Page: [https://snapshot.page/\#/xdaistake.eth TODO](https://snapshot.page/#/xdaistake.eth)

2\) Connect your wallet to Ethereum using Metamask or another application. This wallet should include LATAM you want to use for voting purposes \(or the connected wallet used for EasyStaking, the balances will be combined for your weighted vote\).

## Create a Proposal

Community members can create a proposal for a vote. This is the first step in suggesting or enacting an upgrade. If accepted by the community, the Latam-Blockchain team will assess the viability of the idea and see what next steps are required. **A passed vote does not guarantee a protocol change, but is viewed as a community suggestion and taken into consideration by the team.**

1\) Go to the Latam-Blockhchain Snapshot Page: [https://snapshot.page/\#/xdaistake.eth TODO](https://snapshot.page/#/xdaistake.eth) and connect your  web3 wallet.

2\) Click on New Proposal.
