# USD Stable Coin

USD tokens are used to pay for gas and transactions on Latam-Blockchain. They are a stable token \(worth 1 USDT\) created from locked USDT on foreign networks

## **How to get USD stable coin**

* From another user on Latam-Blockchain.
* Converting USDT to USD using the [Bridge](https://github.com/latam-blockchain/website/tree/aa4cbe03ed18dc72605b2e788c28cc7666804e10/for-users/bridges/converting-usd-via-bridge/README.md). WIP
* Small amounts to pay for transactions can be acquired from the [Latam-Blockchain faucet](https://faucet.latam-blockchain.com) or by asking [Discord Community Members](https://discord.gg/TncBuWdY6B).

## USD Native Token

USD is a cryptocurrency created from the [USDT tokens](https://tether.to/). USDT is a stable token on several chains \(Ethereum, Omnilayer, Tron, Liquid\) and is pegged to the US dollar, the value of USD corresponds 1:1 with USDT. Here's how USD is created:

1. USDT is locked into any bridge smart contract on a foregin network\(Ethereum, Tron, ...\). 
2. Using the bridge mechanisms, the locked USDT amount is minted as USD on the home side Latam-Blockchain.

When users want to exchange USDT for USD, the process is executed in reverse. USD is burned \(destroyed\) in the home side\(Latam-Blockchain, and a verified signal is sent to unlock the exact same amount of USDT on the foreign chain.
