# Welcome to Latam-Blockchain

## Latam-Blockchain The Stable Chain

Latam-Blockchain is a stable payments EVM \(Ethereum Virtual Machine\) blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive transactions. The chain uses a dual-token model; [USD](for-users/get-usd-tokens/)is a stable token used for transactions, payments, and fees, and [LATAM](for-stakers/latam-token/) is a governance token used to support the underlying POSDAO Proof-of-Stake consensus.

ðŸŒ‰ USD Bridges provide the seamless ability to move tokens between chains using the unique [TokenBridge Architecture](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/). Tokens and arbitrary messages can also be passed across chain.

ðŸ”Ž [BlockScout Block Explorer](https://explorer.latam-blockchain.com) provides transactional transparency, custom features and a portal for Latam-Blockchain apps such as LATAM staking, the USD faucet, cross-chain bridge access and monitoring.

## **Latam-Blockchain Developers**

Development on Latam-Blockchain is easy and intuitive for Ethereum developers, cause is an EVM chain, any smart contracts can be written and deployed in exactly the same way simply by setting a [different RPC endpoint.](for-developers/developer-resources/#json-rpc-endpoints) WIP

Any contract that works on the Ethereum can be redeployed to Latam-Blockchain. On Latam-Blockchain, transaction costs are minimized, and all fees and transactions are paid with a single token, USD. **Many tools supporting Ethereum development** are compatible with Latam-Blockchain, including:

* [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/)
* [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/)
* [Remix](https://remix-project.org/)
* [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/)
* [BlockNative](https://www.blocknative.com/)
* [Gnosis Safe MultiSig](https://gnosis-safe.io/)
* [Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/home)
* Many more......

ðŸ›  See [Developer Resources and Tools](for-developers/developer-resources/) to get up-and-running quickly.
