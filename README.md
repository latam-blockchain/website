# Welcome to Latam-Blockchain

{% hint style="info" %}
All the information contained here refers to the research and development stage, any reference to the Ethereum network is actually to Rinkeby _an ethereum test network_, any reference to Latam-Blockchain is about Latam-Blockchain testnet network.

This document serves as a reference for decentralized development as well as determining the critical infrastructure needed, validators incentives, tokenomics, and implementation approach to get on board with the development you can find any work in progress _WIP_ or _TODO_ tag to start with.

Most information here comes from xDai docs and public repositories you can read more about xDai chain [here](https://www.xdaichain.com/)

Please feel free to clone [this document repository](https://github.com/latam-blockchain/website/tree/EN) and summit any change via pull request to us.

To follow the development you can go directly to the [roadmap here](about-latam-blockchain/roadmap.md) or join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/TncBuWdY6B), we speak Spanish too!

## Latam-Blockchain The USDT Stable Chain

Latam-Blockchain is a stable payments EVM \(Ethereum Virtual Machine\) blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive transactions. The chain uses a dual-token model; [USD](for-users/get-usd-coin/) is a stable token used for transactions, payments, and fees, and [LATAM](latam/latam-token/) is a governance token used to support the underlying POSDAO Proof-of-Stake consensus decentralized autonomous organization.

ðŸŒ‰ USD Bridges provide the seamless ability to move tokens between chains using the [TokenBridge Architecture](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/). Tokens and arbitrary messages can also be passed across chains.

ðŸ”Ž [BlockScout Block Explorer](https://explorer.latam-blockchain.com) provides transactional transparency, custom features and a portal for Latam-Blockchain apps such as LATAM staking, the USD faucet, cross-chain bridge access and monitoring.

* [Omnibridge](./) \*TODO

## **Latam-Blockchain Developers**

Development on Latam-Blockchain is easy and intuitive for Ethereum developers, because it is an EVM chain, any smart contracts can be written and deployed in exactly the same way simply by setting a [different RPC endpoint.](for-developers/developer-resources.md#json-rpc-endpoints) \*WIP

Any contract that works on Ethereum can be redeployed to Latam-Blockchain. On Latam-Blockchain, transaction costs are minimized, and all fees and transactions are paid with a single token, USD. **Many tools supporting Ethereum development** are compatible with Latam-Blockchain, including:

* [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/)
* [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/)
* [Remix](https://remix-project.org/)
* [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/)
* [BlockNative](https://www.blocknative.com/)
* [Gnosis Safe MultiSig](https://gnosis-safe.io/)
* [Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/home)
* Many more......

ðŸ›  See [Developer Resources and Tools](for-developers/developer-resources.md) to get up-and-running quickly.

## **Why Latam-Blockchain?**

* âœ…Fast transaction times \(5 seconds\) & low transaction fees \(500 tx for $.01\).
* âœ…Digital cash. A stable chain is ideal for real-world value exchange where 1 USD = 1 USDT.
* âœ…A stable token for transactions & gas fees.
* âœ…A green, energy-efficient, and ecologically aware blockchain network.
* âœ…Permissionless delegated Proof-Of-Stake based consensus with public POSDAO
* âœ…[LATAM token](https://github.com/latam-blockchain/website/tree/6a8c136d94e04b416bd5edfa3716fba8abbc1ed0/for-stakers/latam-token/README.md) for community consensus participation and incentives. 
* âœ…Growing ecosystem designed to support stable person-to-person transactions, micro transactions, DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, games and more.
* âœ…Full-featured  [BlockScout Explorer](https://explorer.latam-blockchain.com).
* âœ…On-chain, decentralized [Random Number Generator](for-developers/on-chain-random-numbers/).
* âœ…Smart Contract, DApp & toolset compatibility with other Ethereum-based chains like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, BSC and others.
* âœ…Based on:
  * [POA](https://www.poa.network/)
  * [xDai](https://www.xdaichain.com/)
