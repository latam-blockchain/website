## Why Latam-Blockchain?

Latam-Blockchain exists to support stable payments and digital cash transactions. Whereas Ethereum transaction costs are unpredictable, subject to congestion, and require several tokens \(for example USDT + Eth for gas\), Latam-Blockchain transactions are fast, very inexpensive, and require a single token \(USD\),  also supports a decentralized, earth-friendly architecture with POSDAO consensus and the LATAM staking token.
