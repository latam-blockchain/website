# LATAM Staking Token FAQ

## If I only need USD coins for transactions, what is LATAM used for?

LATAM is a volatile token used as a staking token to protect the chain. It enables delegated staking and community participation in Latam-Blockchain consensus. It is also used for [LATAM weighted proposal initiation and voting](../../for-users/governance/latam-weighted-voting/).

You do not need LATAM for regular transactions. You only need LATAM if you want to be a validator or delegator on Latam-Blockchain or to participate in governance.

## Why is LATAM an ERC677?

ERC677 is very similar to an ERC20, but includes additional functionality. We use the `transferandCall` functionality to enable easier bridge conversions, moving LATAM from chains.

For more information see the EIP677 standard [https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677).
