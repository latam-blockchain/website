# USD Native Coin/Token FAQ

## What is the main function of the USD coin?

USD is a stable token, used for transactions. It is bridged from USDT to Latam-Blockchain, and used for payments and gas fees. 1 USD = 1 USDT

## How are USD coins minted?

USD is created from USDT(Tether) token - USDT is locked in a bridge contract and the same amount of USD is minted on Latam-Blockchain. USD can then be transformed back into USDT using the same bridging mechanism \(USD is burned and USDT is minted on the foreign chain\).

## How can I get USD coins?

* From another user on Latam-Blockchain.
* Converting USDT to USD using the [USD Bridge](../../for-users/bridges/converting-usd-via-bridge/).

## What makes the USD coin a different kind of stablecoin?

Imagine every time you needed to pay for lunch you had to use 2 different currencies. On top of that, one of those currencies was not stable, so you didn‚Äôt know if you would have to pay an extra $.05 or an extra $.50 in fees for the same $10.00 lunch.üçî

This is what happens every time you use a stablecoin on the Ethereum mainnet. USD eliminates this issue - transaction fees are stable and very low \(500 or so for $.01\). Because they are known & low costs, this also enables stable micro-transactions, which is important for contracts and projects who need to plan for application costs.

Latam-Blockchain stablechain enables digital cash, supporting small denomination transactions for everyday, stable purchases.
