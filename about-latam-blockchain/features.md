# Features

## USD Native Stable Coin

A stable coin means peace of mind. Predictable currencies allow buyers and sellers to exchange value without the risks of volatility. In Latam-Blockchain transactions are conducted using USD, a stable coin with 1:1 value ratio to USDT. Because transactions occur on a bridged chain, they are extremely fast and inexpensive. In addition, transactions and fees are paid with a single coin.

## LATAM  Staking & Governance Token

The LATAM token is used by validators and delegators to secure the chain. Users may participate in chain consensus, either as validators running Latam-Blockchain nodes, or delegators placing LATAM on those nodes. Participants place LATAM to secure the chain, and receive rewards in both LATAM and USD \(for validators\) thanks to[ unique reward mechanics](../for-stakers/latam-token/stake-reward-mechanics/).

LATAM also serves in a governance capacity. Community members can [create and vote on proposals](../for-users/governance/latam-weighted-voting/) to change or update the protocol. These changes are then taken into consideration by the Latam-Blockchain validators and team.

## Neutral Network

Latam-Blockchain provides a vital public utility for users - the ability to transfer stable value free of speculative concerns, volatility, or FUD \(fear, uncertainty & doubt\). Latam-Blockchain is an independent network, built to support transactions that hold value. When USDT is bridged to USD, it moves to a platform with a clear, transparent purpose; secure & stable transactions on a fast, neutral network.

Open governance, open access, and token stability create a trusted environment for users as well as applications built on top of Latam-Blockchain.

## Scalability 

Latam-Blockchain supports low cost, stable transactions for projects and users. high Ethereum gas prices and congestion have made it difficult for the ecosystem to function efficiently. Latam-Blockchain provides a compatible chain for projects requiring nano-transactions or complex transactions that may be prohibitively expensive on Ethereum. the network/chain can scale both vertically \(infrastructure and chain parameter optimization\) and horizontally \(additional chain deployments\) to meet capacity requirements. 

## On-Chain Randomness

Using a RANDAO-based Random Number Generator, validators on Latam-Blockchain produce random numbers used for validator selection. These random seeds are also available for usage by contracts deployed to xDai. This allows for true on-chain randomness, eliminating the need to rely on a centralized service or 3rd party application. More information on how the Latam-Blockchain RNG works is [available here](../for-developers/on-chain-random-numbers/).

## POSDAO Green Consensus

The xDai Stable Chain uses a delegated Proof of Stake \(DPOS\) consensus mechanism called POSDAO. The [POSDAO white paper](../for-validators/posdao-whitepaper.md) describes all aspects of this new consensus protocol including a complete overview of the theory, rationale, security, and a detailed implementation section.

## Bridges to Ethereum

Two bridges connect Latam-Blockchain to the Ethereum mainnet, supporting seamless two-way asset transfer between chains. Tokens are acquired on the mainnet, then bridged to Latam-Blockchain using either the USDT-USD bridge for transactional tokens, or the OmniBridge for any cross-chain transfers. Once a user is finished transacting or staking, tokens can be bridged back to the mainnet with ease.
WIP
### L2 Chain Bridges

Additional bridges exist to move tokens between Latam-Blockchain and other EVM chains TODO
