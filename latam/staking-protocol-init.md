description: staking protocol initialization on Latam-Blockchain
---
{% hint style="info" %}
Staking protocol implememnted only on Latam-Blockchain testnet chain, please refer to [Latam-Blockchain roadmap](../../about-latam-blockchain/roadmap.md) for mainnet release dates.
{% endhint %}


# Phase 1 staking protocol initialization

* Initial validators will receive 20,000 LATAM at the start of the staking protocol. To participate, the entire amount must be staked.
* Initial validators will receive 15% APR in LATAM rewards \(eg 20k LATAM in protocol =~ 250 LATAM / Mo\) . This rate is subject to adjustment in phase 2.
* LATAM will be compartmentalized within mainnet chain. It cannot be moved to the Ethereum until phase 2.

# Phase 2: Easy Staking & Public Staking 

After the LATAM public listing is complete staking on Ethereum will start with EasyStaking and then open up to all public LATAM holders. 

The EasyStaking application will be deployed to the Ethereum and will allow participants with any amount of LATAM to participate. Users can commit LATAM to the protocol, and it will earn additional LATAM based on how long it is placed in the application as well as the total amount staked by all participants.  For more details, see the [EasyStaking page](../easy-staking/).

* Minimum &lt;.0001 LATAM, no Maximum
* Rewards based on time and total amount staked
* [EasyStaking parameters](../easy-staking/easy-staking-parameters.md)
