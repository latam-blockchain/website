# STAKE Tools

[STAKE](../) is an ERC20-type \([implemented as an ERC677](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677)\) token on Ethereum. It is bridged to the xDai chain to support POSDAO consensus on xDai, and is also exchanged on Ethereum. Exchanges include centralized exchanges where STAKE is offered for trade, and decentralized exchanges where users can contribute STAKE and other assets to liquidity pools \(LP\).
