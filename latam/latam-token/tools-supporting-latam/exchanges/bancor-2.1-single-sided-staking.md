# Bancor 2.1 Single-Sided Staking

The STAKE token is now whitelisted on Bancor v2.1. This means participants can participate in single-sided staking to earn swap fees while staking with a single asset. Below, we show you how to stake with STAKE and receive protection against [impermanent loss](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22) over time.

### 5\) STAKE liquidity is now protected.

Your protected STAKE will now appear in the [Protection screen](https://app.bancor.network/eth/protection),\(refresh if needed\) where you can manage your liquidity. 

Compare Protected Value to Initial Stake to see accrued value in swap fees over time.

{% hint style="info" %}
Current Coverage protection increases over time, and starts at 0 for the first 30 days \(the cliff\). When the cliff is reached, you are entitled to 30% coverage. Coverage increases by 1% per day until 100% coverage is reached \(full protection\).
