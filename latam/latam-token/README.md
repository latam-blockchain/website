# LATAM Token

{% hint style="success" %}
LATAM token address on Ethereum [0x886714772777465613959d35C36d84bb3b5FfB0b](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x886714772777465613959d35C36d84bb3b5FfB0b)

LATAM token address on Latam-Blockchain  
[0xeB5bAB615d63C6980B2b24Fa5C99E11f3bCB79a8](https://explorer.latam-blockchain.com/tokens/0xeB5bAB615d63C6980B2b24Fa5C99E11f3bCB79a8/token-transfers)
{% endhint %}

LATAM is a new ERC20-type \([implemented as an ERC677](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677)\) token designed to secure the on-chain payment layer and provide a mechanism for validators to receive multiple POS incentives. It is an ERC20-based staking token with a market driven value.

The initial supply of 8.5375M LATAM tokens will be released over time. Additional tokens are minted as rewards at the conclusion of each staking epoch.

Users \(stakers\) provide LATAM as collateral when participating in the consensus process. In exchange for providing LATAM \(and supporting a node\), users receive multiple rewards. The primary reward is in the form of additional LATAM tokens.

* **LATAM rewards**: LATAM is minted as a reward based on the amount of LATAM placed in the protocol. The final emission rate is TBD through a risk assessment and community review. Target range: ~15% APR. A LATAM transfer fee is also assessed when a user removes their LATAM from Latam-Blockchain \(using the AMB bridge extension\). This fee is distributed as a reward to participating stakers.

## Getting LATAM

LATAM is only on Rinkeby testnet and Latam-Blockchain testnet by now, you can ask in our discord server the release dates for Ethereum mainnet or if you are interested in participating in the private rounds or public offer [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TncBuWdY6B)

## Staking LATAM

Individuals who own LATAM tokens on Latam-Blockchain can place them into the protocol through a [user friendly interface on BlockScout](https://explorer.latam-blockchain.com/validators).

Validator candidates must meet certain requirements before placing LATAM \(the ability to run a functional node and minimum LATAM amounts\). Delegators can place additional LATAM on candidates and receive rewards when the candidates they have placed LATAM on are chosen as validators.

When LATAM is locked in the protocol, rewards for sealing blocks are generated in LATAM and USD. In addition, fees for removing LATAM from Latam-Blockchain are assessed and distributed among active stakers.

## LATAM Total Supply

The LATAM circulating supply is **8,537,500 tokens** \(once all tokens are unlocked in the protocol\). Emissions will increase this value by a maximum of 15% annually.

## LATAM Governance Utility

As the ecosystem matures, LATAM will be used for chain governance, giving holders a chance to update network parameters for optimal performance. This will include items such as validator/delegator minimums, fees, and other aspects of Latam-Blockchain.

Community members can [submit governance proposals and vote with LATAM through Snapshot](https://github.com/latam-blockchain/website/tree/aa4cbe03ed18dc72605b2e788c28cc7666804e10/for-users/governance/stake-weighted-voting/README.md).

In future iterations, holders will have the opportunity to use LATAM in a micro-governance context to determine things like transaction sequencing and priority on a per-block basis, giving a true community voice to the txs written directly to the chain. Value capture related to this concept, known as [Miner Extractable Value](https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-auction-auctioning-transaction-ordering-rights-as-a-solution-to-miner-extractable-value/6788), will give LATAM an intrinsic and important purpose when Eth 2.0 is ready for production.

{% hint style="info" %}
LATAM is a flexible asset, meaning it may be used in a variety of contexts. The initial use case describes leveraging LATAM in the POSDAO implementation, however LATAM may be used for staking \(or other purposes\) by other blockchain networks.
