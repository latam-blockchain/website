# LATAM Reward Mechanics

With POSDAO validator candidates and delegators can place LATAM into the protocol. The amount of LATAM placed determines the corresponding amount of LATAM minted and distributed at the end of a staking epoch. The final emission rate is determined through a risk assessment and community input. The current target is 15% APR.

LATAM rewards may also come from bridge fees assessed when users remove LATAM from the protocol \(move it from the Latam-Blockchain to other chain\). 

## Additional Rewards

LATAM makes up the largest percentage of the staking incentive. Stakers may also receive additional rewards in the form of USD.

* **TBD rewards**.  Due to the configurable nature of the protocol, additional rewards may be introduced in the future.
